# Abstract
The study aims to estimation paddy rice plant height (PH) using UAV remote sensing for evaluation of the growth status of rice in fields. The study area is in Kantharawichai District, Maha Sarakham Province, Thailand. Modeling to estimate the plant height of rice from the correlation between height data from 120 sample field measurements, and reflectance data and digital elevation model (DEM) data was obtained by RGB camera-equipped UAVs, the camera has a resolution of 12 million pixels, the flight recorded an image at an altitude above the ground of 90 meters. and consider the photo data at ground sample distance (GSD) of 5 cm. Analyzed to modeling with a generalized linear model algorithm, the analysis data was divided into two parts for modeling and testing 60 and 40 percent replicas, respectively. The results show that the relationship between measured PH and estimated PH has R2 of 0.70 and RMSE of 0.13 meter. This study shows that the digital elevation model (DEM) from aerial photography with unmanned aerial vehicle, it is an important parameter in estimating the plant height of rice.
