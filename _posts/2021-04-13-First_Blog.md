# Hello

Welcome to haodong's Blog. I will share some daily life, technology notes, academic articles or just some travel photos. I really expect that one day this blog will become popular. If my posts can make you think or give you inspiration, that is what I want to happen most.

Of course on the contrary, please don't hesitate to tell me your suggestions and criticisms in the comment section. One thing I believe is that under such a collision of ideas, we will make progress together.
